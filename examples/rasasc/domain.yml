              Ensure you have adequate reception and a strong data signal.
              Connect to a reliable WIFI network and try sending the message again. Full bars doesn't necessarily indicate a reliable connection, please ensure your bandwidth speeds are fast by running this test.
              If you're sending an attachment that's large in size, it may be causing your network to timeout. Please try resizing/compressing the attachment, and trying again."
