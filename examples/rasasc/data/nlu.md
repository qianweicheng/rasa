- how do i flag my emails  
- how do i change the color of the the flag when i flag emails? 
- what are flags? what does flagging an email do?
- how do i flag a message? 

## intent:flag_error   
- mail that is flagged that is archived doesn't appear in the flagged folder.   
- flagged emails are not showing up in the flagged folder.  
- flagged folder isn’t showing flagged emails
- flagged emails don't show in my flagged section    
- i have flagged some emails in my archive, but they are not showing in the flagged list.    does the flagged list just show the flagged items in the inbox ?     
- when i flag an email that is archived, it does not appear on my flagged email section. is that normal? i would hope to see all my flagged whether or not they are archived. 
- flagging has also serious issues:    - archive an email    - flag email    it doesn't show up in flagged folder    - replace email into inbox    still not showing up in flagged folder      cheers hans    
- flagged emails are not showing up under flagged. they show up under gmail as starred/flagged but not in the app. please fix.    
- when using my exchange account and i flag an email at work it doesn't show that it's flagged on the app. is this normal?  
- flagging an email doesn't send it in my flagged box. how do we fix this issue?    
- flagged emails not appearing in flagged category       
- assistant needs another section flagged so your flagged emails are easy to find :)    
- why can't i like flag a email.    
- i don't know if this is intentional, but if i were to flag an email that is archived, there is no flag indication on the mail and i can't view it from the flag section. it seems i can only view flagged mail that are in my inbox which is useless to me. and viewing the flagged section shows that it's connecting to my mailbox, and then says the connection is slow.
- flagging in not synchronised. if i flag a message on the phone, it is not flagged on other email client, not in the server.        
- please allow for archived emails to be flagged and show up in the flagged folder. currently you must keep an email in your inbox in order to flag it.
- the flag functionality does not flag in my outlook on exchange.
- is it normal that if i flag an email and then archive it's not in the flagged folder?    
- just one thing i've noticed is that when i look for flagged emails in the left panel, it's only showing flagged emails from the inbox and not the archive where i usually keep most of my emails. is there any way to access these flagged emails from the flagged folder like i would in gmail?       
- i found a glitch within the app. if i flag an email and then decide to move that email into a folder, that email will no longer appear under flagged.  this is a big issue, bevause i have many folders and flagged emails within these folders, but i cant find any of them within the flagged folder. they only appear as flagged if they are in my inbox folder. as soon as you move them out of the inbox folder they no longer appear as flagged. 
- how do i flag an email?      i moved a email to inbox from archive, why doesn't it appear?    
- i was viewing my flagged mails and realized that it does not displays that i have flagged but archived. if i click the email account individually and select flagged, i can actually see my archived-but-flagged mails there. so why not the main combined flagged folder? i often flag a mail and archive to tidy up my inbox. please help! thank you.
- i have added my imap account but the flagged items are only appearing in my archive folders and not under the main menu flagged,   i have gone into one message and unflagged then flagged again and it still doesn't get listed in the flagged menu/folder...???

## intent:snooze_error
- i just had an issue where a snoozed email didn't return to the inbox. i received the notification for it, but it was still in the snoozed folder.    
- i just snoozed to emails. i go into my snoozed folder and there is only 1 message and it is neither of the 2vi just snoozed. also i have noticed that i'll get a notification from a snoozed email when it is time to come back but it doesn't show up in my inbox. is it supposed to or just be in the snoozed folder from then on?    
- hello,  how does the snooze option work?  when i set the snooze it goes in the snooze folder and the it disappears from the snoozed folder at the right time.  but i do not see the message come back to me anywhere.
- snoozed emails keep snoozing even if they are completed. but they are not in the snooze folder and can not be removed.    
- just installed the app. snoozed messages disappear from the snoozed folder when i go see all my snoozed messages. this is a big issue.    
- snoozing does not seem to work. messages are snoozed, go out of the inbox, and when i go to the snoozed folder nothing is there?    
- snooze function does not work. for example right now is sat 2.18.2017 9:46 am. snooze option for tomorrow is show saturday 9 am... if i am to snooze the item and go to snoozed folder - as i open the folder snoozed message disappears. thus pretty much making the snooze option unusable...    please fix.    
- i have a email that i snooze and it keeps coming back in my inbox before the snoozed time.   
- i seem to be having an issue with snoozing across devices. if i snooze on one device and open the app on another it doesn't sync those to snooze and then it puts them back into inbox on the device i snoozed it on. how do i fix this?
- how do i disable snooze?  i don't want this app creating a snooze folder in my email account.  
- having issues with snoozing emails, gmail/google apps accounts.  sometimes they bounce back to the inbox or right into archived, or if they do stick in the snoozed folder they say something about being snoozed on another device which i only have 1 iphone and dont show the snooze date/time.  further, conversations (multiple emails) snoozed show no orange bar at the top at all designated snoozed or the snooze date/time.  now i have an email in the snoozed folder/label that the app creates viewing through gmail on the web, but nothing shows on the app under the snoozed category at all.  something is not working with snoozing/syncing folders/labels.
- snoozed mail not visible in snoozed folder?  but is visible in gmail app snooze folder???        
- there are a couple of bug with snoozing:      when i snooze a message for tomorrow, it actually picks today as the day to snooze.      also, there is no option to snooze for later today even though that option appears in settings.        
- mails can only be snoozed once (i frequently snooze them several times)      also, when snoozing the calendar view is better than a list of days    
- a very strange problem: when i snooze messages, it seems like that i can only snooze one message. once i snooze a second one, the first will be popped out of the snoozed folder and reappears in the inbox.    
- snooze seems to be broken with the new update.      i can snooze stuff in easilydo email just fine, however, the snoozed messages aren't actually moved to the snoozed folders anymore. what this means is in apple mail (ios, macos, and icloud), snoozed messages remain in the inbox.      is this a known issue? is there some workaround? snooze is the main feature i use easilydo email for so i would love to figure this out asap. thanks!    
- how does one snooze?    i snoozed an article and it's not in the snoozed mailbox. thank you.
