- i set up a signature and it is not being added to my outgoing emails details i want an outgoing signature on only one of my emails i chose the option to have individual account signatures i created the signature for the one account the signature assistant did not find my desired signature i then tried to send an email with the from being that account the signature was not appended    
- my default gmail signature is not being included in my emails how do i add a signature    
- some time ago i removed all signatures from each account i then turned off the feature to customize the signature per account so none of my accounts have signatures and there are no custom signatures per account i then deleted the signature from the signature setting page at this point there are no signatures defined anywhere within the app i can confirm this works when i create a new mail message no signature however when i attempt to use the share sheet to for example email a safari link to myself a signature appears in the message draft i do not want this its why i removed all signatures why is it happening    
- is there a signature feature on this    
- there was no signature option    
- signature issues have edison email on new ipad pro with ios 12.1. i have the signature setting for customize per account turned on and a signature populated for each account needing a signature however when i compose a new email with the applicable account no signature is inserted    
- hello i recently started having trouble with my email signature the signature assistant is not discovering the new signature i am using even though i changed it a few weeks ago and have sent multiple emails since when i copy paste the signature it looks right in the signature composition box but appears incorrectly when i send emails there is a linked photo in my signature which makes formatting more complicated my job requires that i use this exact signature so please advise how i might fix this

- see there is no signature and i just showed there is a text signature in us put    
- i have three emails setup one with a signature if is under all inboxes and compose an email it starts with my main email with no signature that is fine when i switch to the email with the signature on it by clicking on the from field the signature does not show up submitted    
- signature bug if i have two emails set up and only one has a signature that email has to be the default to get the signature to work if the non signature email is default i can't ever get the signature even by changing the from email address its just does not work submitted

- individual notification sounds reset all the time to the default sound
- i again i have more information re notification sounds issue i believe case 118230 the notification sound from this app still sounds even with notification sounds on the phone turned off it obviously presents as a ringing sound rather than a notification sound on the samsung there are separate controls for notification and ring sounds unlike many other android devices the issue about incorrect selection of sound type was solved by blocking and then unblocking notification sounds for the app i can only assume the setting was incorrect upon initial install but is fine now in short the logic of notification sounds by the app now seems fine the only issue is that notification sounds for this app appear as a ringing sound and are hence controlled on the samsung by the volume control for ringing as this is set loud in my case the notification sound is also annoyingly loud hope you can assist as otherwise this seems to be an excellent email app all the best colin
- i regardless of what i put in the notification settings the app always reverts to a notification sound i would like the badges but with no sound i have set it to no sound but it still makes a sound i have set it to a different sound but it reverts to the default skyline i don't want to turn notifications off altogether but that is the only thing that seems to work please help ian

- every time i scroll down in an email and then i zoom in an email and then zoom out it takes you right to the top of the email   
- the zoom in and out feature does not work properly in portrait mode in the iphone when zooming in it zooms in to what seems to be a preset view after it has zoomed in part of the email is not visible even if trying to scroll also trying to zoom back out is nearly impossible have not tested landscape mode as i don't read my emails in that mode

- it is very difficult to zoom in and out in my emails in your app when i zoom in sometimes it just reverts back to the original view immediately sometimes it will hold my zoomed in view but then when i try to scroll through the email while zoomed it will just immediately go to the zoomed view additionally if zoomed sometimes i can't scroll at all and if i try to zoom up the message appears cut off with no text below the area that was not present before is there a solution thank you for your help    
- i think there are a few bugs with zooming in on emails can only zoom in all the way or none
