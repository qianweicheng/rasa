- is it possible for the edison mail snooze to work with the gmail snooze that is when i snooze in the app the email is not snooze when i look at in gmail
- i ism loving the way easilydo mail lets you see newsletters grouped by subscription and i am really loving the speed of this app but apart from the speed and the a engine it is bazaar behind other is email clients there are also lots of badly broken map bugs i put together a list of of points of whats holding it back ism thinking of publishing this list online but ill let you comment first bug snoozing map when you snooze an email on gmail it properly goes to the snooze folder but if you snooze an email on map it only appears to have moved to the snooze folder but it actually stays in the inbox on the server and is seen there by other email clients bad bug snoozing map snoozing an email twice on map makes it impossible to cancel snooze this bug does not happen on gmail it happens on map and works as follow select an email from the inbox and snooze it it all appear in the virtual snooze folder go to the snooze folder and open the email again and select snooze and set a different time now select the email again from the snooze folder and select snooze and select cancel snooze it wont work the email will stay in the snooze folder on map cancel snooze only works if you do it after the first snooze the second one seems to rewrite the messages metadata so that it thinks that it lives in came from the snooze folder which is probably why cancelling does not work bug map trash folder is not mapped properly and cannot delete emails on map because of that my map trash folder is called trash a very standard name but i see it as all mail
- no snooze
- how do you turn snooze off completely i don't ever want my mail snooze thank you

## intent:change_notification_sound
- the only issue i have is the current version won't allow you to set the sound for email notifications to no sound if select no sound in the picker as soon as you save the setting it goes back to the previous sound
- there is no option for no sound on notification
- how do you set a notification sound for incoming mail
- i can't turn off the notification sound for any emails when i click on the sound options and click none it reverts back to the default sound i'm not sure what to do but i don't want a notification sound for every single email
- customize notification for each account not working when i set a custom sound within a day application lost sound settings and replace it with standard system notification sound
- individual notification sounds reset all the time to the default sound
- how do i change the email notification sound when i go into the settings in your of and choose notifications and then sound it takes me to the android app info page instead of letting me choose a sound
- more sounds please
- i would like to change my notification sounds
- i regardless of what i put in the notification settings the app always reverts to a notification sound i would like the badges but with no sound i have set it to no sound but it still makes a sound i have set it to a different sound but it reverts to the default skyline i don't want to turn notifications off altogether but that is the only thing that seems to work please help ian
- better notification sounds please
- can you please add the option to choose  my inbox notification sound from the sounds from my iphone and the manually installed sounds i have thank you
- i again i have more information re notification sounds issue i believe case 118230 the notification sound from this app still sounds even with notification sounds on the phone turned off it obviously presents as a ringing sound rather than a notification sound on the samsung there are separate controls for notification and ring sounds unlike many other android devices the issue about incorrect selection of sound type was solved by blocking and then unblocking notification sounds for the app i can only assume the setting was incorrect upon initial install but is fine now in short the logic of notification sounds by the app now seems fine the only issue is that notification sounds for this app appear as a ringing sound and are hence controlled on the samsung by the volume control for ringing as this is set loud in my case the notification sound is also annoyingly loud hope you can assist as otherwise this seems to be an excellent email app all the best colin
- how do i change the incoming notification sound on this app when i go to settings in the app and hit sound it takes me to the app info
- notification sounds request
- when i receive notification i always get the default sound but i set the mail sound for all accounts
- cannot turn off notification sounds in the app i select none from the list of sounds but the email app sound setting does not accept this change and retains the default notification sound
- cannot turn notification sound off when sound is setup for all accounts it will not turn off if i set notification sounds up for each account individually my office of a account won't allow sound notification to be turned off must be something with that account type
- sound notifications keep turning on i don't want a sounds notification
- i seems to have developed a notifications bug i don't have sound as an email notification as it would always be going off but the last update i started getting the sound notification on checking the settings when selecting sound to check what sound it was set to instead it took me to the android application settings but weird but i checked again restarted the phone and selecting sound does not take me to the sound selection panel but to the android application settings for this app reluctant to reset the app as it takes a while to set all the accounts again thoughts
- i want to change my notification sounds
- i can you please add the option to choose my inbox notification sound from the sounds from my iphone and the manually installed sounds i have thank you
- i get my emails with badges on the widget but sound notifications is not working sound is set in notifications but its not working
- no sound notification even though all settings are enabled
- notifications i have set notifications to important only and i have set notification sound to mail yet every time i get an an email from ups for a delivery i get a banner notification not something that i or gmail considers important and annoyingly the sound used for that notification is different its the try tone sound rather than the mail sound
- cannot turn off notification sounds in the app i select none from the list of sounds but the email app sound setting does not accept this change and retains the default notification sound mike lucas
